**Data Synchronization Tool
**
**Objective**:

Develop a tool that automates the synchronization of data between disparate systems or databases, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

**Key Features:
**
Bi-Directional Synchronization:
Enable synchronization in both directions, ensuring that changes made in one system are reflected in the other and vice versa.

Support for Multiple Data Sources:
Provide flexibility by supporting various data sources such as relational databases, flat files, REST APIs, and web interfaces.

Customizable Mapping:
Allow users to define custom mappings between fields in different systems. This includes data transformation rules to handle variations in data formats.

Conflict Resolution:
Implement a conflict resolution mechanism to handle scenarios where data is modified in both systems since the last synchronization. Users can configure rules to resolve conflicts automatically or manually.

Automated Schedule:
Integrate with Spring for task scheduling to enable users to set up automated synchronization at predefined intervals.

Logging and Auditing:
Maintain detailed logs of synchronization activities, including successful syncs, failures, and any data discrepancies. Implement an auditing mechanism to track changes made during synchronization.

Error Handling and Notification:
Send notifications in case of synchronization failures or errors. Implement a robust error-handling mechanism to identify and address issues promptly.

Security Measures:
Ensure that the tool adheres to security best practices. Implement encryption for sensitive data, support secure connections, and provide access controls.

Web Interface for Configuration:
Develop a user-friendly web interface using Spring for configuring synchronization settings, mappings, and monitoring synchronization activities.

Scalability:
Design the tool to handle a growing volume of data and users. Consider implementing scalability features, such as distributed processing and load balancing.

Tech Stack:

Java for backend development.
Spring Framework for dependency injection, scheduling, and web development.
Selenium for web interface interaction.
Database of your choice (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for storing configuration settings and logs.

Challenges to Consider:

Dealing with schema changes in synchronized systems.
Efficient handling of large datasets.
Ensuring minimal impact on the performance of synchronized systems during data transfers.

Potential Extensions:

Integration with popular cloud services for data storage and synchronization.
Support for real-time synchronization using messaging queues.


Technical Documentation:

Models:

FieldMapping:

Represents a mapping between a field in the source system (sourceField) and a field in the target system (targetField).
The transformation field is used to define rules for transforming data during synchronization.
Each FieldMapping belongs to a specific SyncConfiguration.


SyncConfiguration:

Represents a configuration for a synchronization task between two systems (sourceSystem and targetSystem).
Includes a name, description, source, target systems, and an indicator of whether it's active (isActive).
Contains a list of FieldMappings associated with the configuration.
Also has a one-to-one relationship with SyncSchedule for defining synchronization schedules.


SyncLog:

Represents log entries for synchronization activities.
Includes a timestamp, status, and a message.
Associated with a specific SyncConfiguration.


SyncSchedule:

Represents a schedule for synchronization tasks.
Uses a cron expression to define when synchronization should occur.
Associated with a specific SyncConfiguration in a one-to-one relationship.
